## Vision Statement
This project consists of integrating The Things Network with a relational database from Amazon
Web Services, designing a visualization for location-based environmental data, and producing
documentation that encourages citizens to participate in the system (a low barrier to entry, low
confusion about the system, and ease of access to information).

This project is being completed for the City of Charlottetown, but is ultimately being created
with the goal of being a citizen-focused system. Citizens of Charlottetown are the primary users
of this system, and primarily those among them that are scientifically minded or want to
contribute to a citizen science project.

This project is being created with the hope of inspiring future development and engagement from
citizens. Engaging citizens with a local project that uses novel technologies in a relatively new
and exciting way is a great way to bring the community together, and a well implemented
solution would be a major help to other communities worldwide who might be interested in a
similar system. Another main goal of this project is to be able to use the recorded data to find
irregularities in certain zones so that they can be addressed. This project was inspired by a very
similar one that was made in Amersfoort.
